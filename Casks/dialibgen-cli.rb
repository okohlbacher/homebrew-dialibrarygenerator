  caveats <<~EOS
    The three AlphaPeptDeep prediction models and CPU training runtime are included.
    DIALIBGEN_MODEL_DIR overrides the bundled prediction models.

    Use -mode generate, -mode refine or -mode tune. See DIALibGen --helphelp
    for native TOPP options and https://github.com/okohlbacher/DIALibGen for examples.
