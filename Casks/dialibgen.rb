  # The binaries are built with a 13.3 deployment target (libc++ shipped the
  # floating-point std::to_chars there). Homebrew's macos symbols name whole
  # releases, so :ventura would admit 13.0-13.2, where dyld refuses to load
  # them -- the cask would install and the tool would never start. Rounded UP
  # to the next release it can promise. 13.3-13.7 users can still unpack the
  # release tarball directly.

  caveats <<~EOS
    The app carries its own copy of the command-line tool. Install
    dialibgen-cli only if you also want it on PATH.

    No model weights are shipped: the app needs the three AlphaPeptDeep ONNX
    exports in one directory, which its Models picker will ask for.
